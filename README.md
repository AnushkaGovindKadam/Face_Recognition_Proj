# Face_Recognition_System_for_Attendance_using_Python
 Hello Everyone , this Repository will contain every information and every code related to this project called as Face Recognition System for Student Attendance using Python. 
 In this project I have used only and only one language i.e Python.
 Even the Frontend is also made by using Python library called as "tkinter".

There are also many libraries used in this projects such as : numpy , opencv , pandas , etc 


In the modern educational environment, traditional methods of marking attendance, such as paper-based or manual logging, are becoming increasingly inefficient and prone to errors. With advancements in artificial intelligence (AI) and computer vision, face recognition technology has emerged as a reliable solution to automate attendance systems. This paper presents a Face Recognition-based Attendance System built entirely using Python, which leverages the power of machine learning and image processing to provide an accurate and real-time method of tracking attendance.

The proposed system is designed to identify and verify individuals based on facial features, ensuring that the attendance process is seamless, fast, and accurate. The backend of the system is developed using Python, with crucial libraries like OpenCV, Face_recognition, and NumPy for image processing, facial recognition, and handling the face data. For data storage, the system utilizes Pandas to manage attendance logs and saves them in a CSV file to maintain a record of the students or employees attending the sessions.
